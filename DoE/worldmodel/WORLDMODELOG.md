# WORLDMODELOG

Yent worldmodel interface log.

## 2026-07-16

- Started as a clean Apple-style probability field beside `yent.html`.
- Kept `yent.html` as the dark Janus/parliament face.
- `worldmodel.html` is the light internal-space surface: selected answer is the manifested path, surrounding words are candidate mass.
- First prototype uses the existing `/chat/completions` SSE token stream. It does not yet receive real top-k/logprob/expert/innerworld telemetry.
- Removed card-like wall sheets and visible wall outlines; walls are now invisible clipped word surfaces.
- Removed fixed vanishing-point compass and idle manifested-answer text.
- Added vertical movement (`R`/`F`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`) and prompt/token-driven topology seeds so the field changes shape from input before full runtime telemetry exists.
- Next contract: split JS into `worldmodel/*.js` once the DoE static route serves subassets safely.
- Next telemetry: replace synthetic candidate mass with real top-k/logprobs, expert votes, Dario/Janus/innerworld metrics, and rejected-token traces.

## 2026-07-19 - import into Yent

- Imported into Yent's inference tree as the first tracked `/worldmodel` surface.
- Paired with `/yent`, the dark Janus parliament face, while both still use the
  existing `/chat/completions` SSE token stream.
- This stage is static/UI-only: no sampling, prompt, Janus, will, wormhole, or
  runtime telemetry semantics changed.

## 2026-07-19 - script split

- Split inline page scripts into explicit tracked subassets:
  `worldmodel/yent.js` and `worldmodel/worldmodel.js`.
- The DoE server exposes only those exact JavaScript paths, not a broad static
  directory.
- Next boundary is telemetry honesty: define real token/logit/expert/Janus/
  innerworld fields before replacing synthetic topology.

## 2026-07-19 - root entry surfaces

- Moved the HTML entry surfaces to repository root: `yent.html` and
  `worldmodel.html`.
- Kept JavaScript under `DoE/worldmodel/`, served by exact routes only.
- The server resolves root HTML first and keeps an adjacent-layout fallback for
  copied binary bundles.

## 2026-07-19 - runtime token telemetry

- Extended `/chat/completions` SSE token events with real observer metrics:
  `token_id`, `step`, `experts`, `debt`, `prophecy_debt`, `field_health`,
  `consensus`, `entropy`, `resonance`, `emergence`, and `temperature`.
- `worldmodel.html` now uses runtime `step` and `entropy` when present, with the
  old synthetic fallback preserved for older streams.
- This is still token-level observability, not top-k/logprob/rejected-token
  geometry.

## 2026-07-19 - bounded candidate distribution

- Added bounded post-sampler `top_tokens` telemetry to each SSE token event,
  including token id, decoded token text, probability, logprob, and selected
  marker.
- Added selected-token probability/logprob/rank plus `candidate_tail_mass` for
  the probability mass outside the displayed top list.
- `worldmodel.html` now feeds alternative top-token words into the surrounding
  candidate mass while keeping the chosen token as the manifested answer.
- Raw pre-sampler logits, full rejected-token traces, and innerworld event
  geometry remain out of this pass.

## 2026-07-19 - weighted candidate projection

- Promoted non-selected `top_tokens` from plain surrounding words into weighted
  candidate entries with probability, rank, logprob, seed, side, age, and decay.
- `worldmodel.html` renders those entries as a short-lived candidate cloud whose
  size, alpha, wake, and motion come from the bounded post-sampler distribution.
- `/yent` keeps selected output as the readable transcript while feeding
  non-selected candidate token text into a separate latent tape for the torn
  Janus face.
- This remains observational UI physics only: no sampler, prompt, weights,
  wormhole, Janus/will, or raw-logit behavior changed.

## 2026-07-19 - candidate telemetry HUD

- Added `P`, `RANK`, and `TAIL` HUD fields to `/worldmodel` and `/yent`.
- These show selected-token probability, selected rank, and candidate tail mass
  only when the SSE stream provides real bounded candidate telemetry.
- Older or partial streams display `-`, avoiding fake certainty from missing
  fields.

## 2026-07-19 - readable manifestation surface

- Added a readable `MANIFEST` answer surface to `/worldmodel`.
- The panel is fed by the same selected SSE token stream as the central canvas
  manifestation, so it exposes the answer without inventing a second text path.
- Candidate clouds, wall words, and Janus/worldmodel physics remain
  observational UI layers only; sampler, prompt, weights, will, wormholes, and
  runtime semantics did not change.

## 2026-07-19 - interface mode switch

- Added a shared `JANUS` / `WORLD` mode switch to `/yent` and `/worldmodel`.
- The switch is plain navigation between the two root HTML surfaces; it does not
  create shared browser state or alter the SSE generation path.

## 2026-07-20 - session handoff between surfaces

- Added a small `sessionStorage` handoff shared by `/yent` and `/worldmodel`.
- The browser tab keeps a bounded recent user/assistant turn list so switching
  interfaces preserves the readable transcript/manifest and seeds the visual
  tape/field from the same selected text.
- Restored handoff turns are display-only. They do not populate the
  `/chat/completions` `messages` request after a view switch.
- This is local UI continuity only, not limpha, model memory, prompt injection,
  sampler state, or a runtime semantic channel.

## 2026-07-20 - shared receipt helper

- Moved the bounded `sessionStorage` normalizer/load/save contract into
  `worldmodel/interface_session.js`.
- `yent.html` and `worldmodel.html` load the helper before their page-specific
  scripts, so JANUS and WORLD cannot drift on receipt shape or message limits.
- The DoE server whitelists `/worldmodel/interface_session.js` explicitly; this
  keeps helper delivery bounded like the two existing page scripts.
- `tests/worldmodel_interface_session_test.go` runs the JS helper test when Node
  is present and also checks script order plus the no-`messages = restored`
  boundary.

## 2026-07-20 - shared event stream parser

- Moved chunked SSE event parsing into `worldmodel/event_stream.js`.
- Both JANUS and WORLD now use `YentEventStream.createParser(...)` instead of
  carrying page-local `parseSseEvents` implementations.
- The shared parser handles chunk boundaries, CRLF frame separators, compact
  `data:{...}` lines, OpenAI-style `[DONE]` sentinels, and malformed frames
  without breaking the UI loop.
- The DoE server whitelists `/worldmodel/event_stream.js` explicitly, and the
  interface contract test checks script order plus removal of local SSE buffers.

## 2026-07-20 - shared chat stream transport

- Moved the browser `/chat/completions` fetch/body/reader/decoder lifecycle into
  `worldmodel/chat_stream.js`.
- JANUS and WORLD now call `YentChatStream.stream(...)` and keep only their
  surface-specific `onToken` effects: transcript/face for JANUS, manifest/field
  for WORLD.
- The helper is loaded after `event_stream.js`, served through an exact DoE
  route, and covered by a Node test plus the shared interface contract test.
